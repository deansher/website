<h1 class="text-centered page-title main-heading">Download Nim</h1>

<h2 class="text-centered">Choose Your Build</h2>

* _Stable builds_ have historically been released a couple of
times a year, with regular maintenance updates thereafter.

* _Nightly builds_ are preferred by many Nim programmers because Nim is
pre-1.0 and Nim development is moving fast.

* _Building from source_ is straightforward if you want to contribute to Nim
  development -- and we hope you do!

<h2 class="text-centered">Choose Your Operating System</h2>

We take pride in fully supporting all three major desktop/backend/embedded
operating systems, both for development and as compilation targets: Windows,
OSX, and a broad spectrum of Unix-based systems. Nim developers on any of
these operating systems can also target JavaScript.

Select your development OS to get started:
